# OmniAuth Authentiq

Official [OmniAuth](https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki) strategy for authenticating with an  Authentiq ID mobile app ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authentiq-id/id964932341),  [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authentiq.authentiqid)).
Application credentials can be obtained [at Authentiq](https://www.authentiq.com/register/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=omniauth).

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-authentiq', '~> 0.2.2'
```

Then bundle:

    $ bundle install

# Basic Usage with Rails

```ruby
use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :authentiq, ENV['AUTHENTIQ_KEY'], ENV['AUTHENTIQ_SECRET'],
           scope: 'aq:name email~rs aq:push'
end
```

# Scopes and redirect uri configuration

Authentiq adds the capability to request personal information like name, email, phone number, and address from the Authentiq ID app ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/authentiq-id/id964932341),  [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.authentiq.authentiqid)).
During authentication, and only after the user consents, this information will be shared by the Authentiq ID app.

Requesting specific information or "scopes" is done by modifying the `scope` parameter in the basic usage example above.
Depending on your implementation, you may also need to provide the `redirect_uri` parameter. 

Example:
```ruby
use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :authentiq, ENV['AUTHENTIQ_KEY'], ENV['AUTHENTIQ_SECRET'], 
           scope: 'aq:name email~rs aq:push phone address',
           redirect_uri: '<REDIRECT_URI>'
end
```

Available scopes are: 
- `aq:name` for name, providing `:name`, `:first_name`, `:last_name` and additionally `:middle_name` will be available in `:extra`
- `email` providing `:email` and additionally `:email_verified` will be available in `:extra`
- `phone` providing `:phone` and additionally `:phone_type` and `:phone_number_verified` will be available in `:extra`
- `address` providing `:location` with the following format: 
```ruby
"location" => {
    "country" => "Country",
    "formatted" => "Street\nCity\nPostal Code\nState\nCountry",
    "locality" => "City",
    "postal_code" => "Postal Code",
    "state" => "State",
    "street_address" => "Street"
}
```
- `aq:location` providing `:geolocation` (geo coordinates and address from a reverse lookup) with the following format: 
```ruby
"geolocation" => {
    "accuracy" => 20.509,
    "address" => {
        "country" => "Geo country",
        "formatted" => "Geo street\nGeo city\nGeo postal_code\nGeo country",
        "locality" => "Geo city",
        "postal_code" => "Geo postal_code",
        "street_address" => "Geo street"
    },
    "altitude" => 0.0,
    "latitude" => 55.340157,
    "longitude" => -30.555491,
    "speed" => 0.0
}
```
- `aq:push` to request permission to sign in via Push Notifications in the Authentiq ID app

`:locale` and `:zoneinfo` will be available in `:extra` regardless of the requested scopes. The format of these strings is:
- `locale` providing `:locale` in the `language_territory` format
- `zoneinfo` providing `:zoneinfo` in the `Continent/City` format

Append `~r` to a scope to explicitly require it from the user.

Append `~s` to phone or email scope to explicitly require a verified (signed) scope.

The `~s` and `~r` can be combined to `~rs` to indicate that the scope is both required and should be / have been verified.

# Response data
An example complete response, in the form of a ruby hash, after requesting all possible scopes would be:
